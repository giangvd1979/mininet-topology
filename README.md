## Install

### From source

```
git clone <this-project-git-url>
cd mininet-topology
sudo python setup.py install
```

### Dependencies

The dependencies to run this tool are

- [Mininet](https://github.com/mininet)
- [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/)

**Scapy** is installed automatically when this project is installed.

**Mininet** is not installed by this project. Following commands shows how to installed from command line.

```
git clone https://github.com/mininet/mininet.git

cd mininet
git checkout tags/2.2.1
cd ..
sed -i 's/git:\/\/openflowswitch.org\/openflow.git/https:\/\/github.com\/mininet\/openflow.git/g' mininet/util/install.sh
sed -i 's/git:\/\/gitosis.stanford.edu\/oflops.git/https:\/\/github.com\/mininet\/oflops.git/g' mininet/util/install.sh
mininet/util/install.sh -n3fv
```

Mininet current only supports up to 3 mpls label in a packet. Following lines will update Mininet with the given number of labels (`10` in following example commands).

```
## execute as root
sudo su

MPLS_MAX=10
OVS_FILE=http://openvswitch.org/releases/openvswitch-2.5.0.tar.gz


# remove current OVS
apt-get remove openvswitch-common openvswitch-datapath-dkms openvswitch-controller openvswitch-pki openvswitch-switch -y


cd /root
rm -rf ../openvswitch*deb

## Usage

### Mininet topology

Execute either `sudo mnyml [topology-file-name]` to create a topology based on given topology file. This scripts command just starts a Mininet topology using OVS switches.

### Test utilities

This tool provides two tester utilites `mntest` and `mnfm`. The options are very similar and the main difference is `mntest` will configure the flows/groups for the given directory. `mnfm` will create automatically eline services and check if these services works.

Flow Manager tester checks if flows, groups and services runs properly on the given topology. It makes following tasks:

* cleanup any previous Mininet network using Mininet `cleanup` method
* starts a Mininet network based on give YAML topology
* configure an eline/path sr services for each given pair of hosts
* checks if SDN controller has discovered all nodes and links properly
* checks if pings works between each pair of hosts for given services
* checks if flows are generated properly. Checking if all flows in OVS switches, Openflow model (configuration and operational) and Flow Manager models are in sync. For OVS switches pulls the information using `dump-flows` and `dump-groups` command. For the rest it uses BSC REST API.
* stops Mininet and executes Mininet `cleanup` method
* check if all nodes and links are removed
* check if all flows are removed properly from Openflow and FlowManager model.
* repeats previous steps as a loop

Execute either `sudo mnfm [topology-file-name]` or `sudo mntest [topology-file-name]`

Following are the attributes that can be added to the topology yaml file to include Flow Manager testing capabilities.

* **ping**: a list of `source` and `destination` hosts to configure a eline/path service. `fmmn` will test the ping between the two hosts. If not provided and `check_bsc` is True, then a ping service for each couple of hosts will be created.
* **loop**: True if it should loop the whole testing process. Default `True`.
* **loop_max**: maximum loops. Default `20`.
* **retries**: maximum of retries in case of detected error. Default `60`.
* **retry_interval**: retry interval in seconds. Default `5`.
* **check_links**: `True` if links are discovered or removed properly when Mininet start/stop. Default `True`.
* **check_nodes**: `True` if nodes are discovered or removed properly when Mininet start/stop. Default `True`.
* **check_flows**: `True` if flows are installed or removed properly when Mininet start/stop. Default `True`.
* **check_bsc**: `True` if flows in brocade-bsc-openflow model has to be checked. Default `True`.
* **recreate_services**: `True` if services should be removed/create every time thata Miniet stop/start. Default `False`.
* **servicesdir**: a directory where this solution can save and recover flows and groups configuration

```

  ping:
    - source: h101
      destination: h104
  loop: True
  loop_max: 10
  loop_interval: 0
  retries: 12
  retry_interval: 5
  check_links: True
  check_nodes: True

  servicesdir: 'services'
```

### Topology generators

This utility provides a couple of commands to quickly create topologies. Two examples are given, `Table Topology` for given rows and columns and `DataCenter topology` for given number of spines and leafs.

See following sections for further information.

- [Table Topology Generator](#table-topology-generator)
- [Datacenter Topology Generator](#datacenter-topology-generator)


## Packet Generator

`mnsend` and `mnrecv` commands create packets based on **Scapy** format and validate these packets has been received on the egress side.

### Sending packets

`mnsend` requires to be executed in a host or switch inside of Mininet network. If not, packets will not be inserted in the Mininet network unless we use a interface from the compute running Mininet connected to the Mininet network.

The main argument required by `mnsend` is a packet. For example, sending an ICMP packet with a vlan can be achieved by `mnsend 'Ether() / Dot1Q(vlan=100) / IP() / ICMP()'`

Please, refer to [Scapy documentation](http://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to understand how packets can be created.

This command also provides options such `count` to define the number of packets to be sent or `iface` which defines the interface to be used.

Refer to `mnsend -h` for further information.


### Validating if packet has been received

`mnrecv` counts if given number of packets has been received for a period of time. The main parameter is to be provided is `filter` in [BPF](http://biot.com/capstats/bpf.html) format.

For example, `mnrecv "vlan 100" -c 10 -t 60` checks if 10 packets has been received with vlan 100 for a maximum of 60 seconds time.



## Mininet YAML description

The YAML file is composed on 4 main ArgumentParser

* **Controller**: a list of controllers identified by name and ip address

```
controller:
  - name : c0
    ip : 172.24.86.214
```


* **host**: a list of host identified by name. It must also contain a network and gateway

```
host:
- name: h101
  ip: 10.0.1.1/16
  gw: 10.0.0.1
- name: h102
  ip: 10.0.1.2/16
  gw: 10.0.0.1
```


* **switch**: a list of switches identified by name. It must also contain a dpip and protocol version. Dpid is in hexadecimal format without the `0x` prefix.

```
switch:
  - name: s11
    dpid: B
    protocols: OpenFlow13
  - name: s12
    dpid: C
    protocols: OpenFlow13
```

* **link**: a list of links that can connect either a host with a switch or a switch with a switch. It is possible to define multiple links between two nodes just repeating the value. In the following example, h11 is connected to s11. Also, two links connects s11 and s12

```
link:
  - source: h11
    destination: s11
  - source: s11
    destination: s12
  - source: s11
    destination: s12    
```


* **interface**: a list of interfaces on the host connected to the Mininet switches. This is typically empty unless we want to connect Mininet to an external network.

```
interface:
  - name: eth1
    switch: s11   
```


## Datacenter Topology Generator

**topodc** creates a topology yaml file like a datacenter with spines, leafs and computes.

Following optional parameters can be provided:
* **output file name** (default `mn-topo.yml`)

* number of **spines** (default `4`)
* number of **leafs** (default `12`)
* number of **computes** connected to each leaf (default `10`)
* **controllers**


Example, a datacenter with 3 spines, 4 leafs and 5 compute per leaf will be created by `topodc -s 3 -l 4 -c 5`

```
$  topodc -h
